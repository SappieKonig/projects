In order to achieve high quality, models always make, often reasonable, assumptions. 

Here I try to list some of them to get my mind right, and so I can sleep instead of think.

GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS:
  - the loss landscape is smooth
  - a low loss corresponds to high accuracy (not really an assumption as it is mathematically provable, but there is some play in this regime)
  - plenty more but let's not think more, gotta sleep, this is meant to clear my mind not fill it
  
  
  
Most interesting ones, assumption of UNSUPERVISED networks:
  - SwAV --> coherence of scene
  - Depth estimation --> coherence of temporal scenes (staticity of position)
  
  
Interesting notes:
  - The assumptions of depth estimation can be reformulated as the first law of Newton
  - Humans might very well learn these assumption through a predictive model.
    How in god's name do you combine a predictive model and unsupervised learning?
  
  
  Humans make these same assumptions when learning, are these a priori or LEARNT biases?
  
What other assumptions can be made (currently video-centric without audio --> I'm a visual person, sue me)?
  - What belongs to "an object" can be seen as something at a consistent depth at relatively constant speeds. (sizes of objects are limited compared to their surroundings + Newton's first law)
  - Objects whose center of movement corresponds with another object can be fused --> arms of a human body
  
  
  
AGE OLD QUESTION:
  - These assumptions are all biases, and as far as humans know, they are human biases. What sort of system could spawn these biases?
  - If the system that spawns these biases is "one extra layer of abstractions", then by that formulation, is there ever a limit? And if there isn't, can it be right?
    It feels like trying to learn something by looking at its 100th derivative, it does not feel effective per se after the first few steps.
  - NOW LISTEN HERE YOU LITTLE SHIT, BEFORE GOING ALL PHILOSOPHY HOW ABOUT YOU TRY EVEN FUCKING ONE OF THESE?
  - Step by step program: 1. Research unsupervised approaches, they ain't hard but they well implemented.
                          2. Mix in assumptions.
                          3. Make general so assumptions can be thrown in on the fly.
                          4. Throw in some multi-modality, because FUCK YES.
                          5. Buy google.
                          6. Beg for citations.
                          7. Gogogadget conference.
                          8. Profit.
  
 
OF COURSE THERE ARE PLENTY MORE, BUT AT THIS POINT IN TIME THESE LEAD MY THOUGHT PROCESS
